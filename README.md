been completely written in Clojure(Script) and employs the following libs,
whose authors we will always be grateful to:

## BACK END

### Deploy

In order to generate the artifact, execute `lein uberjar`.

This will create `target/lambdax-web-standalone.jar` that can be launched in a script:

```

# export LAMBDAX_WEB_PORT=3000              # default for Prod is 3001
# export LAMBDAX_WEB_NREPL_PORT=45555       # default is 0, aka auto selection
# export LAMBDAX_WEB_FETCH_EVERY=           # default 360000 (in seconds)

export LAMBDAX_WEB_VERSION=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT # not shown unless specified with this variable
java -jar target/lambdax-web-standalone.jar
```

Note that the `config.clj` in the project for prod is under "env/prod/clj".

### Develop

The classic `lein repl` works but you can also use `nohup lein bg-repl` (logs to repl.err/out).

Note that the `lambdax-web.config` namespace in `env/dev/clj` contains the
default configuration and can be further customized using the above environment
variables.

## FRONT END

### Deploy

To create a production build run:

`lein cljsbuild once min`

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.

### Develop

To get an interactive development environment run:

`lein figwheel`

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

`(js/alert "Am I connected?")`

and you should see an alert in the browser window.
